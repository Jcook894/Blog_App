# Blog Application.

## About.

A blog application I made using React and Redux. By using Redux, I was able to make calls to an API to store data and manipulate that data using React.

## How to run.

 To run this application, clone or unzip the file. Once downloaded, open up the terminal and run:

* npm install

 Once all the dependencies are downloaded, you can run a simple server courtesy of webpack dev server by running this in the terminal:


* npm start
